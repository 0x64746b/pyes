Admin API
=========

The Java admin API provides exactly the same functionality as the REST :doc:`admin </elasticsearch/rest_api/admin/index>` with all the different methods. Getting the indices admin is done using **Client#admin()#indices()**, and the cluster admin is done using **Client#admin()#cluster()**.


Using the API follows the same principals as the other main APIs, and its parameters and usage have full javadoc.
