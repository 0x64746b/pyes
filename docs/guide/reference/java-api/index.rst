Java Api
========

This section describes the Java API elasticsearch provides. All of elasticsearch APIs are executed using a :doc:`Client <./client.html>`,  and are completely asynchronous in nature (either accepts a listener, or return a future).


Note, all the :doc:`APIs <.//guide/reference/api>`  are exposed through the Java API (actually, the Java API is used internally to execute them).


Maven Repository
----------------

elasticsearch is hosted on `Sonatype <http://www.sonatype.org/>`_,  with both a `releases repo <http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/>`_  and a `snapshots repo <http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots>`_.
